      "context  last semester i was taking  11 credits in grad school  all i did was play world of warcraft most of the time  i studied a minimal amount each week and spent the rest playing games or watching netflix  i did however change my diet last semester to primarily vegetables and rice and lost 25 pounds  215   gt  190 at 6 4     oops  i guess i should mention i am a 22 year old male   anyway  i wanted to change my daily life to better myself for this semester  here are the things i wanted to do     either no more video games or a heavy reduction in time spent playing   reading   spend time reading books   start lifting weights again for the first time in years   find new hobbies to replace drinking on the weekends   through the other changes  be more confident   get a summer internship  i have accomplished most of this list  despite taking a ridiculous 15 graduate credit hours  i should be able to get 3 a s and 2 b s   i completely quit and turned off world of warcraft and star wars  the old republic  this opened up a huge amount of time  this allowed me to start reading some  i quickly read hitchhikers  ender s game  and ender s shadow  i plan on reading a couple more of the ender series  then i have about 10 other books waiting on my kindle to be read   i started lifting weights 6 days a week in late january  i have been very persistent in going  my parents visited in the middle of march during my spring break and they made a lot of comments regarding me being muscular  despite me not mentioning that i started lifting   i put on about 25 pounds since late january  i m fairly certain a good portion of that is from the creatine i am taking  the rest is hopefully largely from added muscle and then a little amount of fat   i ve also gone on two hiking trips so far and excited to do another  each trip was at a different canyon in north texas and both were really fun  i grew up on a farm so it is nice to get back out and enjoy nature  other than hiking as a new hobby  i have been playing frisbee golf every so often  it is much more fun than i thought and another good way to be outside   i still haven t found an internship though for the summer  i really need to start trying harder    also  i am still getting coaxed into drinking more than i d like  i need to find some way to go out  but not drink into oblivion   this ended up being a bit longer than expected haha  i just don t really have anyone to tell this too that wouldn t be annoyed and jealous  p\n",

      "the title pretty much says it all  this whole thing kind of started with my parents who basically spoiled me and never challenged me on anything  this is great when you re 14 but not so much when you re 25 and trying to build grown up relationships  frankly i m kind of sick of getting into arguments with my incredibly supportive girlfriend because my brain decides to get pissy about the stupidest little coments   i kind of lack that ability to just rise above stuff and would love some advice stories anecdotes about ways you guys have dealt with over sensitive natures either in yourself or those close to you   help me shrug off criticism  not clam up like a threatened hedgehog when confronted by a potential argument and generally stop being an over sensitive pussy   cheers guys\n",
