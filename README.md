# selfimprovement

### Lab 1 

1- [TF-IDF experimentation](tfidf.py): This file takes a dataframe of reddit posts on the r/selfimprovement. Converts it to TF-IDF vectors and then uses LSH for identifying posts that could be similar to a fake post that talks about morality. 

2- [Word2Vec experimentation](word2vec.py): This file takes a dataframe of reddit posts on the r/selfimprovement. Converts it to word2vec vectors and then uses LSH for identifying posts that could be similar to a fake post that talks about morality. 

3 - [TF-IDF batch script](tfidf.sbatch) and [word2vec batch script](word2vec.sbatch) to run jobs on midway cluster.

4 - [Output of TF-IDF experimentation](tfidf.out) and [output of word2vec experimentation](word2vec.out)

5 - [Notebook](exploring_reddit.ipynb) exploring the found similar reddit posts from TF-IDF LSH.
