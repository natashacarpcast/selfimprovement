      "|hello one of my goals is to improve my personal relationships this year i female 24 have always struggled with maintaining close friendships and relationships with my family im very independent and like to do things on my own but its caused me to feel quite isolated especially as i get older and dont have the social fabric of school to fall back on i have never enjoyed the level of emotional intimacy required to have a close friendship especially with other women and my closest friends have always been guys because i find they never push you to talk about your feelings  its very difficult for me to give myself fully to relationships i always feel like im holding back i dont like emotionally investing in others or being truly honest about the person i am ive seen it said that when you feel like you arent truly yourself around others its because you dont like yourself and the insecurity makes you have to try to be the person you think theyd want but its really quite the opposite for me i really like who i am as a person so much i want to protect it and preserve my true self which involves not lettings others in at all i dont like giving others the chance to truly know me because of trust issues but i feel like it goes deeper than that and im just trying to understand myself better so that i can be a better friend sister daughter etc moving forward in my life  so heres me actively committing to that and if anyone has any advice on how to get over the scariness of opening yourself up to other people id greatly appreciate it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n",
      "|ampx200b  i became so angry and bitter and alone that even being online didnt help me i know the answer is therapy and i already try to do that but as for the last 23 years i feel like i have seen read and heard every single song the internet can offer that is of course dramatization but please hear me out however people also make me lonely and sometimes i am too traumatized or depressed to even smile which makes it hard to make friends but in the past i used to fake smile a lot but due to bullying i was so mentally broken that i cant smile or express emotions anymore due to being pushed and pushed and pushed only to be laughed at whether i was angry sad or tried to defend my self i was always quick to anger and clearly have problems but for whatever reason rarely had friends which meant it was free real estate to make me feel bad and humiliate me unlike middle school i developed many symtpoms like constant head and stomach aches and puked due to stress and no one cared for that i am much more calm now but unless i am hateful i dont calm down i may become sarcastic but people say and do pretty nasty things and bullies always gaslight you and i always had a hard time standing my ground i try to be more assertive as a woman and all and the internet definetly saved and ruined me cause it made me happy but my social skills became worse due to not practicing or being only surrounded by classmates which either hated or ignroed me the lack of connection and verbal communication at moments ruined me and i felt in so much pain that i laughed at weird intervals  i felt utterly broken and despite my flaws i dont think i deserved the bullying ive seen far weirder and stupider people than me and wonder how they werent bullied since my problem was basically social anxiety i had hard time giving presentations or speaking out loud yet there are people who literally look and act insane and would be beaten up for that behavior where i live yet the most cruel nosy and cold people had the best treatment i struggle to be kind anymore and am more neutral and severely physically tired as if ive ran a marathon and i am only 21 i want to be more active and social but hate partiesclubs and clubs of interests cost money what activities can i do on my ownfind social events i strugle to smile and express emotions due to being laughed at and made fun of for everything even how i breathe cause they lacked material and all i did was just exist but i hate how i had to become smaller and invisible cause i couldnt stand my ground i feel like kidness has failed me but violence wasnt going to solve it either not cause so much i was afraid but cause they didnt really hit me they just insulted me and threw things at me but were nasty about it and i am sensitive i did take some self defense wing tjun classes but my problem isnt that i cant hit back but that i lack confidence and freeze even though i am a girl it makes me weak when it comes to bullyingdominationabuse it seems everything in me screams weak which worries me which is why i spent so much time online i was severely disconnected and lonely how can i be more social as an introvert how can i trust people  how can i express emotions i am pretty short and weak so physical violence and threats especially as an adult aint it but most fights are just gaslighitng mind games in real life and not so much fists i struggle with words and being witty and standing up for my self and making friends true genuine friends i also struggle with dating since my bullies were always guys                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",

      "|tldr in 22 i picked a topic to begin improving and gradually added in the rest i have been able to slowly work on improving my mental physical emotional and financial health ive also completed stagnated projects decluttered material possessions and reignited past interestshobbies my plan for 23 is to refine and strengthen the systems i have in place to the point where they are integrated with who i am i want them to become subconscious habits versus shallow taxing conscious work that ebbs in time  i had no idea where or how to begin improving many facets of myself and my life granted i knew i wasnt the same person i was 1 5 or 10 years ago but i felt like i had stagnated at the end of 21 and beginning of 22 about 6 months into 22 i finally started somewhere it was a slow ball to get rolling but when it caught it picked up speed   i picked a topic to start versus trying to hit them all at once as i had tried and failed to do in the past from there i slowly integrated more and more heres where i improved   mental health  i was able to find the root issue and have that properly treated versus treating the symptoms in years prior i had thought my symptoms were my issues but eventually hit a wall with managing those through encouragement from trusted friends delving deeper during my therapy sessions and seeking out the right professionals i received a proper diagnosis that has allowed me to finally breathe    physical health  during the midst of appointments for figuring out my mental health i began to slowly improve my physical health i eased into changing my diet and watching whathow much i consumed i increased my water intake to what i roughly should have as an active individual 5 to 1 oz for every pound i weighed i was also more conscientious of my daily activity levels in roughly 6 mo i lost 40 lbs granted i was 15 lbs short of my goal i learned to celebrate the progress i made and the ability to maintain give or take 5 lb fluctuations ill begin being more strict again since i proved to myself i am able to maintain   emotional health  after creating consistency with the two prior aspects i focused on assessing managing and processing my emotions therapy and additional personal research aided i worked on processing difficult emotions surrounding core memories during therapy which positively flowed into my daily life and responses to difficult situations i looked for selfhelp books to improve my communication skills and habits which in turn aided in how i viewed implementing the skills i wanted to use ive seen improvement in my intimate and platonic relationships ive also been able to recognize where boundaries are necessary and slowly implement and maintain them my emotional regulation listening skills confidence patience and selflove has improved im comfortable with who i am recognize where i need improvement and heed criticism from trusted individuals    financial health  i reevaluated my spending and cut down in areas that were unnecessary i consolidated much of my debt that i aim to pay off within a year to possibly two i have a small nest eggemergency fund its the longest lasting attempt ive ever had in my life ive learned and adjusted to becoming frugal in necessary areas of life wout feeling deprived of luxeries ive also prepped mostly with food in anticipation for difficult economic situations that will lead to tight finances   odds amp ends  ive completed two hobby projects albeit easy i never made time or maintained focus for either ive decluttered and organize much of my material items objects i had forgotten or remained unused for extended periods of time were donated or tossed clothing that no longer fit or wore were donated broken items with intention to fix or use for something were tossed accordingly my past enjoyment for reading writing and variations of art was reignited   i recognize that its a lot to start andor complete in a short amount of time this could lead to failure in the future if im not consistent however ive been able to create positive systems although still rough outlines to attain my goals   23 is my year to focus on refining and strengthening these systems i plan to ensure they last me the long haul regardless if i reach my goals or fail i want to integrate these positive changes with who i am in time i hope theyll become subconscious habits instead of draining conscious work|\n",

      "|tldr in 22 i picked a topic to begin improving and gradually added in the rest i have been able to slowly work on improving my mental physical emotional and financial health ive also completed stagnated projects decluttered material possessions and reignited past interestshobbies my plan for 23 is to refine and strengthen the systems i have in place to the point where they are integrated with who i am i want them to become subconscious habits versus shallow taxing conscious work that ebbs in time  i had no idea where or how to begin improving many facets of myself and my life granted i knew i wasnt the same person i was 1 5 or 10 years ago but i felt like i had stagnated at the end of 21 and beginning of 22 about 6 months into 22 i finally started somewhere it was a slow ball to get rolling but when it caught it picked up speed   i picked a topic to start versus trying to hit them all at once as i had tried and failed to do in the past from there i slowly integrated more and more heres where i improved   mental health  i was able to find the root issue and have that properly treated versus treating the symptoms in years prior i had thought my symptoms were my issues but eventually hit a wall with managing those through encouragement from trusted friends delving deeper during my therapy sessions and seeking out the right professionals i received a proper diagnosis that has allowed me to finally breathe    physical health  during the midst of appointments for figuring out my mental health i began to slowly improve my physical health i eased into changing my diet and watching whathow much i consumed i increased my water intake to what i roughly should have as an active individual 5 to 1 oz for every pound i weighed i was also more conscientious of my daily activity levels in roughly 6 mo i lost 40 lbs granted i was 15 lbs short of my goal i learned to celebrate the progress i made and the ability to maintain give or take 5 lb fluctuations ill begin being more strict again since i proved to myself i am able to maintain   emotional health  after creating consistency with the two prior aspects i focused on assessing managing and processing my emotions therapy and additional personal research aided i worked on processing difficult emotions surrounding core memories during therapy which positively flowed into my daily life and responses to difficult situations i looked for selfhelp books to improve my communication skills and habits which in turn aided in how i viewed implementing the skills i wanted to use ive seen improvement in my intimate and platonic relationships ive also been able to recognize where boundaries are necessary and slowly implement and maintain them my emotional regulation listening skills confidence patience and selflove has improved im comfortable with who i am recognize where i need improvement and heed criticism from trusted individuals    financial health  i reevaluated my spending and cut down in areas that were unnecessary i consolidated much of my debt that i aim to pay off within a year to possibly two i have a small nest eggemergency fund its the longest lasting attempt ive ever had in my life ive learned and adjusted to becoming frugal in necessary areas of life wout feeling deprived of luxeries ive also prepped mostly with food in anticipation for difficult economic situations that will lead to tight finances   odds amp ends  ive completed two hobby projects albeit easy i never made time or maintained focus for either ive decluttered and organize much of my material items objects i had forgotten or remained unused for extended periods of time were donated or tossed clothing that no longer fit or wore were donated broken items with intention to fix or use for something were tossed accordingly my past enjoyment for reading writing and variations of art was reignited   i recognize that its a lot to start andor complete in a short amount of time this could lead to failure in the future if im not consistent however ive been able to create positive systems although still rough outlines to attain my goals   23 is my year to focus on refining and strengthening these systems i plan to ensure they last me the long haul regardless if i reach my goals or fail i want to integrate these positive changes with who i am in time i hope theyll become subconscious habits instead of draining conscious work|\n",
